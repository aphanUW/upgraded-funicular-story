There lived a man named Ted. He lived in a magical forest with tree-like
mushrooms, fantastical creatures such as faeries, imps, and water nymphs, and
ancient, forgotten ruins. Away from towns and vilages, Ted lived in this forest
for age upon age rarely if ever seeing another human such as himself. On a 
calm, sunny day, Ted would find a lad with bright, red hair and a mysterious,
omnious amulet. Ted's life would forever change that day.
