There lived a man named Ted. He lived in a magical forest with tree-like
mushrooms, fantastical creatures such as faeries, imps, and water nymphs, and
ancient, forgotten ruins. Away from towns and vilages, Ted lived in this forest
for age upon age rarely if ever seeing another human such as himself. On a 
calm, sunny day, Ted would find a lad with bright, red hair and a mysterious,
omnious amulet. Ted's life would forever change that day.

The lad said to Ted, "I have this amulet I am giving to you, only you can
unlock its true power, the power to Yeet things with the force of a thousand
Yeets." Ted replied "What?". "I said the power to Yeet things with the force
of a thousand Yeets. You can use this new power to defeat Lord Pumpkin Spice."
I will leave now, have fun on your adventure.
